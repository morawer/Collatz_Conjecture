# Collatz_Conjecture

I thought to create this script after to watch [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA "Veritasium Youtube Channel") video about the Collatz conjecture.

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/094y1Z2wpJg/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg)

I started this script to practice the recursivity and learn to create graphics with python more or less like this:

In the beggining i have been testing 'pylab' module to create a simple graph for only one number. This graphic shows us the differents values takes and the iterations of the number you intruduces for input.

In the following days i will try to make the graphic with more values in the same time.
